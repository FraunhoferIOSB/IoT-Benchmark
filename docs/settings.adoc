== Environment Variable 
=== Common Settings for all Load Components

|===
| Parameter | Description | Default

| BASE_URL  | Server instance to be used for the benchmark data.This is the main server where the bulk data are being created and where the IT workload is accumulated. | http://localhost:8080/FROST-Server/v1.0/

| RESULT_URL | Server instance for storing performance evaluation result data in a condensed format. The amount of data will be significantly less than the BASE server.  | default
| BROKER | The MQTT broker address to be used for publish/subscribe based communications. | -
| SESSION | Benchmark Session Identifier to be used within the Benchmark thing. | -
| NAME | The name of the application primitive, used for identifying the application primitive for changing settings during the benchmark execution and the statistical evaluation data generated by this primitive. | -
| WORKERS | Number of parallel worker threads to be used for performing the benchmark tasks. | 10
| JITTER | Jitter in milliseconds between worker tasks. This value is used to create some spread in the workload patterns. | 5
| PERIOD | Delay between scheduled tasks in milliseconds per sensor. A task can be the creation of an observation or the start of a calculation loop in the analytic cluster. | 500

Beside these common settings, for some cluster components there are some specific parameters.


=== Specific Sensor Cluster Settings


|===
| Parameter | Description | Default

| SENSORS | Number of sensor objects to be used. There is a data stream for each sensor where the observations are posted. | 20
| CACHE_FOI | If true, the first Observation from a Sensor is posted normally, but all subsequent Observations are posted with the explicit FeatureOfInterest retrieved from the first Observation. | false
|===



=== Specific Analytics Cluster Settings

|===
| Parameter | Description | Default

| ANALYTIC_JOBS | Number of parallel worker threads to be used for performing the benchmark tasks. | 20
| ANALYTIC_LOOPS | Number of analytic loops to performed with each execution. | 20
|===


=== Specific Subscriber and Stream Processor Cluster

|===
| Parameter | Description | Default

| COVERAGE | Percentage of subscribed data streams. All data streams with the same session identifier are used as reference for subscription. |
|===


=== Specific Stream Processor Cluster Settings

WARNING: This is work in progress!

|===
| Parameter | Description | Default

| FACTOR | Streaming factor to define the ratio between number of received and emitted observations. A factor of 1 means that one new observation is created for each received observation. |
